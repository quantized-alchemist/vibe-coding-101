# 🎧 Vibe Coding 101: Startup Ritual

Welcome to **Vibe Coding** – a creative, intuitive approach to building with AI. This method blends structured code with emergent flow states and collaborative improvisation. Whether you're new to the idea or a seasoned vibe engineer, this document will guide your first steps.

## 🛠️ Setup Checklist

1. **Read the Requirements Doc**
   - Located in `docs/requirements.md`
   - Understand the intention and scope of the session

2. **Ensure Dependencies Are Installed**
   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Optional: `conda` environment or `venv` activation

3. **Open `prompt.py`**
   - This is your conversational interface with the LLM
   - You can use tools like Cursor, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook

4. **Copy and Paste Prompt into LLM**
   - Use an AI model (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
   - Paste the prompt and enter dialogue mode

5. **Vibe** 🎶
   - Allow intuition and creativity to steer the direction
   - Use metaphors, sketches, examples – think like a co-creator, not just a coder

6. **See Where It Goes**
   - Let the code evolve
   - Branch ideas, explore tangents, follow curiosity

7. **Document / Commit?**
   - Decide what to keep: `notes.md`, `commits`, or a shared output repo
   - Record your process for reuse, feedback, or poetic trace

## ✨ Philosophy

> Vibe coding is about resonance.  
> It's less about forcing output and more about aligning your intent with a generative system.  
> The best results often emerge—not from planning—but from presence.

Use this framework to:
- Build projects collaboratively with AI
- Teach coding as conversation
- Explore software as an art form
